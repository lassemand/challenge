# What pattern is used?

You are given 3 files (`PatternA`, `PatternB` & `PatternC`) which each implement a different design pattern.
Your task is to determine what pattern is used.

# Solution

Each _pattern file_ will have a comment block where you can write your answer and comments.

If you see `/* Write your answers and comments below this line */` you've found the rigth place :-)

## What you'll be evaluated on

You'll be evaluated on the ability to determine what pattern is used.
Extra points are given if you can write some pros or cons about the pattern.
